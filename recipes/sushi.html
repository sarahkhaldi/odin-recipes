 <div class="recipe-steps">
  <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
  <ol>
   <li>In a saucepan, heat the water until boil, then add rice and reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed the water. Rice can also be cooked in an Instant pot or rice cooker, my preference.</li>
   <li>In a small saucepan combine rice vinegar, avocado oil, cane sugar, and salt. Cook on medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves, it takes about 3-5 min</li>
   <li>Pour the mixture into cooked warm rice then Stir till the mixture is absorbed.</li>
   <li>Let cool aside.</li>
   <li>Laying out the bamboo mat with a piece of plastic wrap on top, as will make the cleaning easier and prevent the rice from sticking to the mat.</li>
   <li>After folding the nori sheets in half and splitting them, go ahead and place one half on top of the bamboo shining side facing down.</li>
   <li>Now, take about ¾ cup of the sushi rice and spread it evenly over the nori then sprinkle the sesame seeds.</li>
   <li>Carefully, flip the nori sheet, so the rice is face down and the nori is up.</li>
   <li>Add the avocado slices and the cooked eel in the middle of the norie.</li>
   <li>To close the roll, place your thumbs underneath the bamboo mat in order to lift the edge up and over the filling then roll the bamboo mat away from you while pressing the rice and filling together.</li>
   <li>Keep rolling until the ends meet.</li>
   <li>Move your eel roll to a cutting board then cut it into about 8 pieces.</li>
   <li>Finally, drizzle the eel sauce on top of the rolls, you can also top with some masago or tobiko for some extra delicious
   flavor.</li>
   <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
